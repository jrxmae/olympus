## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Present a website reminiscent of an ancient Greek temple to emit the feeling of travelling through history.

* Offer alternative options for the user to gain information such as a video if they are unable to read.

* Provide the user with concise information as too much text will be overwhelming.

### User Stories

* A user should be able to easily navigate the website.

* A user should be able to read and understand clearly what is written.

* A user should be able to contact the website in some way.

* A user should be able to choose between different options when filling out the form.

* A user should be able to visit the social media pages of the website, providing they have one.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/read-me-files/color-scheme.jpg)

The main colors in this website are shades of beige and blue with off-white used for icons, dark grey for contrast and black for hover and text.

### Typography

The main font is 'GFS Neohellenic' with Sans-Serif as fallback. 'Cinzel' is used in the header and navigation bar with Serif as fallback. Lastly, 'GFS Didot' is used in heading of the main content with Serif as fallback.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

* A user should be able to easily navigate the website.

    - With smaller screen sizes, the website offers a dropdown menu to accommodate the space. When the screen is larger, the menu spreads out to fill the screen space.

    - The current active page will be underlined in white, a different color to the text so as not to confuse the user.

* A user should be able to read and understand clearly what is written.

    - The text is in black to stand out against the light background color, the size readjusts depending on the screen size and the font used is clear.

* A user should be able to contact the website in some way.

    - There is a 'Contact Us' provided in the home page where they can find an email and a phone number. 

* A user should be able to choose between different options when filling out the form.

    - In the form section, the user can choose to their preferred way of receiving the newsletter.

* A user should be able to visit the social media pages of the website, providing they have one.

    - At the bottom of the page, on the footer, there are four icons provided with links to their corresponding social media website.

    - The user can choose where to follow the website and each link opens in a new tab, not hidering their browsing of this website.

    3. When you're in the settings, locate the 'Pages' section.
    
    4. Find 'Source' and make sure you have 'Deploy from a branch' selected. Underneath 'Branch', make sure to change from 'none' to 'main' and that it is set to '/root' beside it.

    5. Head back to the 'Code' from the menu tabs and after a few minutes, a link to your website should generate on the top of that page.
